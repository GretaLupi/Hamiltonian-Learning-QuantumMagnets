# Hamiltonian Learning Quantum Magnets - Datasets & Models

This repository contains the datasets and models used in the paper:  
**"Hamiltonian Learning of Quantum Magnets with Non-Local Impurity Tomography"**  

## 📂 Contents
- **Datasets:** Numerical simulations for spin and fermionic chains with impurity-based tomography.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementations of Hamiltonian learning algorithms.

## 📜 Description
Our work explores Hamiltonian learning in quantum magnets using impurity-based tomography. We provide datasets and models to facilitate reproducibility and further research in quantum many-body systems, topology, and machine learning for physics.

## 🔧 Requirements
To use the models, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Datasets
The repository includes:

- **Spin Chain Datasets** (datasets/spinchain_data_Bx.csv & spinchain_data_Bz.csv):
  - Contains spin correlation calculations with spin-1 impurity perturbation.
  - Both Bx and Bz case.
- **Fermionic Chain Dataset** (datasets/ferm_chain_data.csv):
  - Includes impurity responses in fermionic systems
  - Useful for benchmarking Hamiltonian learning methods.
